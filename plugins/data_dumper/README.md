# Data Dumper \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/data_dumper/data_dumper.zip)\]

This plugin saves the output for the track and release metadata to a text file.  By default, the file is called 'data_dump.txt' and it is saved in the file naming destination directory.  When the plugin is enabled, it runs automatically each time a release is retrieved from MusicBrainz, overwriting the output file with the new information.

This can be used to help develop release and track plugins by providing a log of the information passed to the plugin.
