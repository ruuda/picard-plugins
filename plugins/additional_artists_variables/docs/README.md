# Additional Artists Variables \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/additional_artists_variables/additional_artists_variables.zip)\]

## Overview

This plugin provides specialized album and track variables for use in naming scripts. It is based on the
"Album Artist Extension" plugin, but expands the functionality to also include track artists. Note that it
cannot be used as a direct drop-in replacement for the "Album Artist Extension" plugin because the variables
are provided with different names.  This will require changes to existing scripts if switching to this plugin.

---

## What it Does

This plugin reads the album and track metadata provided to Picard and exposes the information in a number
of additional variables for use in Picard scripts.  The plugin has been designed such that the information
is presented consistently regardless of whether or not the `Use standardized artist names` option is selected.
This means that some of the information available through the standard Picard tags will be duplicated in the
variables provided by this plugin.

***NOTE:*** This plugin makes no additional calls to the MusicBrainz website api for the information.

## Examples

The following are some examples using actual information from MusicBrainz:

### Example 1:

Using the single "[Fairytale of New York](https://musicbrainz.org/release/e428018c-5536-47f7-aca7-581e748b6fd5)"
by [Walk Off The Earth](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/e2a5eaeb-7de7-4ffe-a519-e18e427a5060) (credited as
"Gianni and Sarah"), the additional artist variables created are:

* **_artists_album_primary_id** = e2a5eaeb-7de7-4ffe-a519-e18e427a5060
* **_artists_album_primary_std** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_album_primary_cred** = Gianni and Sarah
* **_artists_album_primary_sort** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_album_all_std** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_album_all_cred** = Gianni and Sarah
* **_artists_album_all_sort** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_album_all_legal** = Walk off the Earth
* **_artists_album_all_legal_multi** = \['n/a'\]
* **_artists_album_all_sort_primary** = Walk Off The Earth
* **_artists_album_all_types** = \['Group'\]
* **_artists_album_all_count** = 1
* **_artists_track_primary_id** = e2a5eaeb-7de7-4ffe-a519-e18e427a5060
* **_artists_track_primary_std** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_track_primary_cred** = Gianni and Sarah
* **_artists_track_primary_sort** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_track_all_std** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_track_all_cred** = Gianni and Sarah
* **_artists_track_all_sort** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_track_all_legal** = Walk off the Earth
* **_artists_track_all_std_multi** = \['Walk Off The Earth'\]
* **_artists_track_all_cred_multi** = \['Gianni and Sarah'\]
* **_artists_track_all_legal_multi** = \['n/a'\]
* **_artists_track_all_sort_primary** = Walk off The Earth
* **_artists_track_all_types** = \['Group'\]
* **_artists_track_all_count** = 1

Because there is only one artist associated with this single, the **_artists_album_additional\_\***, **_artists_track_additional\_\***, **_artists_album_all_join_phrases**, and **_artists_track_all_join_phrases** variables are not created.
Because there is no legal name alias for the artist, the **_artists_album_primary_legal**, **_artists_album_primary_sort_legal**, **_artists_track_primary_legal** and **_artists_track_primary_sort_legal** variables are not created.

* **_artists_track_additional_std_multi** = \['Jenni Pleau', 'Emily Bones'\]
* **_artists_track_additional_cred_multi** = \['Jenni Pleau', 'Emily Bones'\]
* **_artists_track_additional_sort_multi** = \['Pleau, Jenni', 'Bones, Emily'\]
* **_artists_track_additional_legal_multi** = \['n/a', 'n/a'\]
* **_artists_track_all_std** = Sarah Blackwood, Jenni Pleau & Emily Bones
* **_artists_track_all_cred** = Sarah Blackwood, Jenni Pleau & Emily Bones
* **_artists_track_all_sort** = Blackwood, Sarah, Pleau, Jenni & Bones, Emily

Because there are multiple artists associated with both the album and the track, all artist variables are created.

### Example 3:

Using the album "[Kermit Unpigged](https://musicbrainz.org/release/860fd92f-6899-4b31-a205-d6b746da734e)" by
[The Muppets](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/2ca340a6-e8f2-489d-90c2-f37c5c802d49), the additional artist variables
created for track 4, "[All I Have to Do Is Dream](https://musicbrainz.org/recording/5d98e4d4-be42-4412-94ad-f19562faa416)"
by [Linda Ronstadt](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/498f2581-be21-4eef-8756-fbb89d79b1c0) and
[Kermit the Frog](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/992a7ea8-96c1-4058-ba96-f811c8d01c77), are:

* **_artists_album_primary_id** = 2ca340a6-e8f2-489d-90c2-f37c5c802d49
* **_artists_album_primary_std** = The Muppets
* **_artists_album_primary_cred** = The Muppets

* **_artists_album_all_legal** = The Muppets
* **_artists_album_all_legal_multi** = \['n/a'\]

* **_artists_track_additional_sort_multi** = \['Kermit the Frog'\]
* **_artists_album_additional_legal_multi** = \['n/a'\]
* **_artists_track_all_std** = Linda Ronstadt and Kermit the Frog
* **_artists_track_all_cred** = Linda Ronstadt and Kermit the Frog
* **_artists_track_all_sort** = Ronstadt, Linda and Kermit the Frog
* **_artists_track_all_legal** = Linda Maria Ronstadt and Kermit the Frog

* **_artists_track_all_join_phrases** = \[' and '\]
* **_artists_track_all_types** = \['Person', 'Character'\]
* **_artists_track_all_count** = 2

Because there is only one artist associated with the album the **_artists_album_additional\_\*** and **_artists_album_all_join_phrases** variables are not created.
